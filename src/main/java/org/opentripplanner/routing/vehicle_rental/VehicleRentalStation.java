/**
 * This class models a place where a rental vehicle can be returned or picked up.
 * This class is typically used in one of 3 ways:
 *
 * 1. To model a docking station that may have multiple vehicles that can be rented and also parking spaces to return
 *  a rented vehicle.
 * 2. To model a single floating vehicle that can only be picked up.
 * 3. To model a border dropoff where the extent of vehicle rental region ends. At this point, the StreetEdge is split
 *  and a vehicle rental station is created to facilitate the dropoff of vehicles no further than the allowable dropoff
 *  area.
 * FIXME: border dropoff stations, vertices and edges are probably not needed anymore with updated StreetEdge dropoff
 *  checks.
